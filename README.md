My band project

My website was designed to have a home page with 5 subsidiary pages - History,
Music, Images, Videos and Hire Us.  All the pages are at one level, 
so navigation is possible between all of them.

Bootstrap was used for the grid system, allowing the main body to be divided 
into two or three distinct sections.

Each page has the same basic structure - Header, Menu bar, Body and Footer.  
The Header, Menu Bar and Footer are the same on all pages, with the current 
page being highlighted on the menu bar.

Every page (except Hire Us) contains a 'Want to Hire Us' note.

The footer contains links to the Social sites - Facebook, Twitter and YouTube 
and another 'Hire Us' offer with link.

As the brief stressed the band's willingness to perform at functions, each page 
contains three different links to the 'Hire Us' contact page.

The History page contains a brief outline of the possible history of the band.

Music contains four links to music tracks.

Images contains a number of pictures in three columns for wide devices, 
reducing to two columns for smaller devices, then one column for phones.

Videos contains a single video clip.

The Hire Us page simply contains a contact form with some instructions on the
details required.

The web site was tested for functionality and responsiveness within Cloud9.
As changes were applied, each page was reloaded and then tested to ensure it  
reacted satisfactorily for different screen sizes.
